![Tract-level map of population changes between 2010 and 2020, according to census data released Aug. 12, 2021.](https://github.com/mcclatchy-southeast/census2020/blob/main/images/nc_tract_change.png)
On Aug. 12, the U.S. Census Bureau will release the [2020 redistricting data summary (P.L. 94-171)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/rdo/summary-files.html), its nationwide file created for use by state legislatures in their decennial redraw of congressional and legislative lines.

Accept where noted below, the following information is specific to data for North Carolina.

## Data files

For more details on the data and related methodology, [check out the readme file](https://github.com/mcclatchy-southeast/census2020/tree/main/data).

### 2020 data

[**2020 race and ethnicity, by county**](https://github.com/mcclatchy-southeast/census2020/blob/main/data/nc_county_2020_rc_eth.csv) Select columns from 2020 population counts of race and ethnicity on the county summary level.

[**2020 race and ethnicity, by place**](https://github.com/mcclatchy-southeast/census2020/blob/main/data/nc_places_2020_rc_eth.csv) Select columns from 2020 population counts of race and ethnicity on the place summary level.

[**2020 race and ethnicity, by tract**](https://github.com/mcclatchy-southeast/census2020/blob/main/data/nc_tracts_2020_rc_eth.csv) Select columns from 2020 population counts of race and ethnicity on the tract summary level.

[**2020 race and ethnicity, by block**](https://github.com/mcclatchy-southeast/census2020/blob/main/data/nc_blocks_2020_rc_eth.csv) Select columns from 2020 population counts of race and ethnicity on the block summary level. *NOTE: The U.S. Census Bureau advises that [due to noise in the block-level values](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/director/2021/07/redistricting-data.html), data should be aggregated to higher levels, like block groups or tracts.* 

[**NC block assignment file, with weights**](https://github.com/mcclatchy-southeast/census2020/blob/main/data/nc_baf_2010_2010_weighted.csv) Used to remap 2010 population counts to the redrawn 2020 block for aggregation up to the tract level. Weights are calculated using the intersection of each 2010 block with the 2020 block divided by the total area of the 2010 block ( `AREALAND_INT` / `AREALAND_2010` ) for all 2010 blocks split into parts ( `BLOCK_PART_FLAG_O == 'p'` ). *NOTE: NHGIS on Aug. 9 [published identical figures](https://www.nhgis.org/nhgis-news#crosswalks-2021-08a) used to translate 2010 blocks to 2020 blocks here (free with signup).*

[**2010 and 2020 diversity index comparisons, by county**](https://github.com/mcclatchy-southeast/census2020/blob/main/data/nc_county_2010_2020_diversity_index.csv) County-level calculation of the diversity index, a value from 0 to 1 indicating the probability that two people selected at random would be from different racial/ethnic backgrounds. Uses categories for `white alone, non-Hispanic`, `Black, non-Hispanic`, `American Indian, non-Hispanic`, `Asian, non-Hispanic`, `native Hawaiian or Pacific islander, non-Hispanic`, `other, non-Hispanic`, `two or more races, non-Hispanic` and `Hispanic` in the probability calculation.

[**2010 and 2020 diversity index comparisons, by place**](https://github.com/mcclatchy-southeast/census2020/blob/main/data/nc_place_2010_2020_diversity_index.csv) Place-level calculation of the diversity index, a value from 0 to 1 indicating the probability that two people selected at random would be from different racial/ethnic backgrounds. Uses categories for `white alone, non-Hispanic`, `Black, non-Hispanic`, `American Indian, non-Hispanic`, `Asian, non-Hispanic`, `native Hawaiian or Pacific islander, non-Hispanic`, `other, non-Hispanic`, `two or more races, non-Hispanic` and `Hispanic` in the probability calculation.

[**2010 and 2020 diversity index comparisons, weighted/aggregated to 2020 tracts**](https://github.com/mcclatchy-southeast/census2020/blob/main/data/nc_tracts_2010_2020_diversity_index.csv) Tract-level calculation of the diversity index, a value from 0 to 1 indicating the probability that two people selected at random would be from different racial/ethnic backgrounds. Population data from 2010 is remapped to 2020 block shapes using land area weights from the block assignment file and aggregated up to 2020 tracts. Uses categories for `white alone, non-Hispanic`, `Black, non-Hispanic`, `American Indian, non-Hispanic`, `Asian, non-Hispanic`, `native Hawaiian or Pacific islander, non-Hispanic`, `other, non-Hispanic`, `two or more races, non-Hispanic` and `Hispanic` in the probability calculation.

[**2020 housing units, by county**](https://github.com/mcclatchy-southeast/census2020/blob/main/data/nc_county_2020_housing.csv) Columns from 2020 housing counts on the county summary level.

[**2020 housing units, by place**](https://github.com/mcclatchy-southeast/census2020/blob/main/data/nc_places_2020_housing.csv) Columns from 2020 housing counts on the place summary level.

[**2020 housing units, by tract**](https://github.com/mcclatchy-southeast/census2020/blob/main/data/nc_tracts_2020_housing.csv) Columns from 2020 housing counts on the tract summary level.

[**2020 housing units, by block**](https://github.com/mcclatchy-southeast/census2020/blob/main/data/nc_blocks_2020_housing.csv) Columns from 2020 housing counts on the block summary level. *NOTE: The U.S. Census Bureau advises that because housing counts were not subject to processing with differential privacy algorithms, this table is accurate to the block level, but won't be comparable to block level data on race and ethnicity.* 

**2020 race and ethnicity, weighted/aggregated to 117th congressional districts** *COMING SOON*

Used for aggregation up to large geographies. *NOTE: The U.S. Census Bureau advises that [due to noise in the block-level values](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/director/2021/07/redistricting-data.html), data should be aggregated to higher levels, like block groups or tracts.*

## Story recipes

The team at Carolina Demography put together [a great (still in-progress) how-to guide](https://www.ncdemography.org/2021/08/11/census-2020-story-recipe-how-to-find-and-explore-census-data/) on using R to work with the 2020 census redistricting data, [including sample scripts](https://github.com/mcclatchy-southeast/census2020/blob/main/scripts/story_recipe_pl94171.R) you can use to get started.

You can also take a look at the [McClatchy team's own R scripts](https://github.com/mcclatchy-southeast/census2020/blob/main/scripts/mcc_sample_scripts.R) for loading in and cleaning up the data.
